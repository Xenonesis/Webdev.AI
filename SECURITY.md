## 🚨 Reporting Vulnerabilities

### 🔒 Private Disclosure

For security vulnerabilities, please **DO NOT** create public GitHub issues. Instead, report them privately:

#### Primary Contact
- 📧 **Email**: [Create a private security advisory](https://github.com/Xenonesis/Webdev.AI/security/advisories/new)
- 🔐 **GitHub Security**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
- 📱 **Direct Contact**: Reach out to maintainers directly for critical issues

#### What to Include

Please provide the following information:
- 📝 **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- 🔍 **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed reproduction steps
- 💥 **Impact Assessment**: Potential impact and affected components
- 🛠️ **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation
- 🌍 **Environment**: OS, Node.js version, browser details
- 📸 **Evidence**: Screenshots, logs, or proof-of-concept (if safe)

#### Response Timeline

- 📅 **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- 🔍 **Triage**: Within 5 business days
- 🛠️ **Fix Development**: Depends on severity (see below)
- 📢 **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and deployed

### ⚡ Severity Levels

| Severity | Response Time | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| 🔴 **Critical** | 24-48 hours | Remote code execution, data breach |
| 🟠 **High** | 3-5 days | Privilege escalation, authentication bypass |
| 🟡 **Medium** | 1-2 weeks | Information disclosure, CSRF |
| 🟢 **Low** | 2-4 weeks | Minor information leaks, low-impact issues |

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### 🔑 API Key Security
- **Never commit** API keys to version control
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
- **Rotate keys regularly** and revoke unused keys
- **Limit API key permissions** to minimum required scope

```bash
# ✅ Good: Use environment variables
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# ❌ Bad: Never hardcode in source
const apiKey = "AIzaSyC..."; // DON'T DO THIS
```

#### 🌐 Deployment Security
- **Use HTTPS** for all production deployments
- **Enable CORS** properly for your domain
- **Set secure headers** (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- **Keep dependencies updated** regularly

#### 💻 Development Security
- **Keep Node.js updated** to latest LTS version
- **Run security audits** regularly: `npm audit`
- **Use trusted packages** and review dependencies
- **Enable two-factor authentication** on GitHub

### For Contributors

#### 🧪 Code Security
- **Validate all inputs** from users and external APIs
- **Sanitize outputs** to prevent XSS attacks
- **Use parameterized queries** for database operations
- **Implement proper authentication** and authorization

#### 🔍 Security Testing
- **Run security linters** (ESLint security rules)
- **Test for common vulnerabilities** (OWASP Top 10)
- **Review third-party dependencies** for known issues
- **Use security-focused testing tools**

## ⚠️ Known Security Considerations

### 🤖 AI Integration
- **API Key Exposure**: Ensure Google AI API keys are properly secured
- **Prompt Injection**: Be aware of potential AI prompt manipulation
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement proper rate limiting for AI requests
- **Data Privacy**: AI prompts may be logged by external services

### 🌐 WebContainer API
- **Sandboxing**: WebContainer provides isolation but has limitations
- **Resource Limits**: Implement proper resource constraints
- **Code Execution**: User-generated code runs in controlled environment
- **Network Access**: Limited network access in WebContainer environment

### 🔧 Development Environment
- **Local File Access**: File operations are sandboxed to project directory
- **Terminal Access**: Integrated terminal has limited system access
- **Package Installation**: npm packages run in controlled environment
- **Port Binding**: Development servers bind to localhost only

## 🔄 Security Updates

### 📦 Dependency Management
We regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix automatically fixable issues
npm audit fix

# Update all dependencies
npm update
```

### 🚀 Automated Security
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **CodeQL**: Static analysis for security issues
- **Security Advisories**: GitHub security advisory monitoring
- **CI/CD Security**: Automated security testing in pipelines

## 📢 Responsible Disclosure

### 🤝 Our Commitment
- **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge your report within 48 hours
- **Communication**: Regular updates on investigation progress
- **Credit**: Public recognition for responsible disclosure (if desired)
- **No Legal Action**: We won't pursue legal action for good-faith research

### 🏆 Recognition
Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be:
- 📜 **Listed** in our security acknowledgments
- 🎖️ **Credited** in release notes and security advisories
- 🎁 **Eligible** for ThunderDev swag and recognition
- 🌟 **Featured** in our contributor spotlight

### 📋 Disclosure Guidelines
1. **Give us time** to fix the issue before public disclosure
2. **Don't access** or modify user data without permission
3. **Avoid destructive** testing or denial of service attacks
4. **Respect user privacy** and don't access personal information
5. **Follow responsible** disclosure practices
